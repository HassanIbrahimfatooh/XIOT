The Assumptions :                                                                                                    
      1- I Worked in eclipse as a c project     
      2- There is no serial monitor in eclipse then i assumed that it will print in the screen as a printf() function is called           
      3- All drivers i made it before so i just included it                                                                           


The instructions for setting the app up:                                                                                                  
      1- Create New C Project                                                                                                           
      2- AVR Empty AVR Project                                                                                                             
      3- Choose the type of the MCU (ATmega32) in our case  * The Project will then be created*                                                 4- Create New Source File (Main.c)                                                                                                  
      5- Include any driver you made before or make a new one if you didn't                                                             
      6- Complete your Project
