- This project is working in two modes :                                                                                                      
Mode 1 : Regular Mode : There is an ADC to convert from analog to digital from a temprature sensor and display the output as a digital 
value into PORTC                                                                                                                              
Mode 2 : Interrupt Mode : When the interrupt button is clicked PORTB will be ON to light on some LEDS                                   

- This project is a good practice for ADC and Interrupt, I have made projects with more complexity by the way. 
- I have a pervious experince in C Language and Microcontrollers.
